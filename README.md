# IntrotoProgramming1
Repo for all of my homework and projects from my Intro to Programming Course at UMGC

Week 1
=======================================================================================

Write a Java program which assigns your name to one variable and some other numerical value you want to share to another variable (e.g. age, number of pets,  number of children, etc.). Then print a greeting along with the value of the name variable to the screen on one line and a message that uses the other variable with numerical value to another line.

For example, my program would be: 

Hello class, my name is: Dr. Mcfadden
I have visited 20 states

Submit your program as an attached  .java file and post a screen shot to show that you have been able to successfully run that program. Make sure you submission adheres to the SubmissionRequirements document.

Be sure to create a program different from any of the programs already posted by your classmates or the examples in class materials.

Week 2
=============================================================================================================
Assignment 1

Write a Java program which:

(1) Prompts a user to enter customer id, unit price in this format (e.g. 3.75), quantity (as whole number), product description, and discount in this format (e.g., .10) (use Scanner for input).

(2) Calculates the customer's overall order total before and after discount.

(3) Displays the input data along with the order total before and after the discount to the console.

Assignment 2

Write a Java program which prompts a user for two numerical values as input, does some calculation on them and then print the result along with meaningful message to the console. Use some interesting formula and not a simple summation.

Week 3
=============================================================================================================
Assignment 1

Write a Java program which prompts a user for input and depending on that input prints a different value to the console - use if-else statement in your program.

Assignment 2

Write a Java program which:

(1) Prompts a user to enter two numbers between 200 and 1000 and a symbol for operation
such as ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’,and ‘/’ (use Scanner for input).

(2) Code uses nested if statement or switch to perform the operation on the two numbers

(3) If the provided symbol is valid, displays the input data along with the result of the calculation
to the console. Otherwise displays an error message


Week 4
=============================================================================================================
Write a Java program which contains a while loop. Prompt user for input which determines the number of times the loop repeats. 
The program should display some output for each iteration but it should be more than just an increment.

Assignment 1

Write a Java program to calculate a gamer's total XP score with a bonus per level. The program should:
(1) Prompt and read user’s input for the gamer's name, Level 1 XP (L1), Level 2 XP (L2), Level 3 XP (L3), and Engagement score (ES). User Scanner to read input.
(2) Each XP score input should be in whole numbers between 10-100 and in increments of 5. The total XP score with bonuses should be calculated as follows:
L1+L1*0.20+L2+L2*0.30+L3+L3*0.50+ES+ES*0.60
(3) Output the gamer's information and the total calculated XP score (including bonuses).
(4) Prompt the user as to whether they want to calculate total XP for another gamer and repeat the input/output processing
(5) Allow user to exit the program without inputting gamer's data


Week 5
=============================================================================================================
Write a Java program that contains a for-loop loop. Prompt user for input which determines the number of times the loop repeats. 
The program should display some output for each iteration but it should be more than just an increment.


Assignment 1
Write Java code to prompt the user for the number of rows (e.g. 7) and output the triangle pattern below using nested for-loops.

Assignment 2
Write Java code to prompt the user for the starting number to print (e.g. 5) and output rectangular pattern below: Use nested for-loops.
